# Price Optimization

#### What is Price Optimization?
One of the ways machine learning has helped businesses is price optimization. It addresses a lot of problems that retailers face in their businesses
Price optimization is a strategic approach used by businesses to determine the most effective and profitable pricing strategies for their products or services.

#### Pricing Strategies
- The first step in an optimization plan is to determine the business goal.
- Changing and adjusting the price of goods and services in response to market factors.
- Market research and evaluation of competition

#### Types of Pricing Strategies
- **Cost Plus Pricing:** In this strategy, all the costs relating to the unit to be sold are combined and a margin is added. The advantage of this strategy is that it is easy to justify and is typically fair and nondiscriminatory. However, it has one drawback: the customer is not taken into account.

- **Psychological Pricing:** Psychological pricing is a pricing strategy designed to boost consumer demand by creating a perceptual illusion of increased value. It capitalizes on the psychological tendencies of consumers who tend to react differently to prices based on the way they are presented. 
For example, setting the price of a product, such as a watch, at $199 is more likely to attract new customers compared to pricing it at $200, even though the actual price difference is minimal. This is because consumers tend to perceive prices just below a round number (e.g., $199) as significantly lower than those just above it (e.g., $200). 
This perceptual trick is based on the way our brains process information. When we see a price like $199, we often focus on the leftmost digit (the "1") and round it down to $100 in our minds, making the product seem much cheaper than it actually is. This perception can influence consumer behavior, making them more inclined to make a purchase. 
Psychological pricing is a common strategy used to leverage these psychological biases and encourage consumer spending, ultimately benefiting businesses through increased sales and revenue.

- **Premium Pricing:** Businesses set their prices higher because they have a unique product or brand that no one can rival. It is possible to use this strategy if you have a significant competitive advantage and are confident you can charge a higher price without being undercut by similar products. In order to create a perception that products are worth the higher price tag, a company must work hard in all directions, such as packaging, decor in the store, and marketing strategy to create the perception that products are worth the higher price.

#### Price Optimization and Automation
- **Dynamic Pricing:** It involves adjusting the price online, based on changes in demand, supply, or other market conditions. According to AI and ML technologies, the analysis of large volumes of data has become available. See [Dynamic_Pricing.md](C:\Users\HP\Documents\KESHTECH\DSML\Projects\Retail_Price_Optimization_ML_Regression\Dynamic_Pricing.md)

- **Predictive Analytics:** As a result of the symbiosis between statistical methods and machine learning methods, predictive analytics produces future results. Business owners use predictive analytics to optimize pricing based on customer behavior and other factors affecting sales. They analyze historical data. See [Predictive_Analytics.md]()

- **Demand Forecasting:** A Pop demand forecast is based on historical data, market trends, and a number of other factors that influence sales. With the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning, we can analyze a large amount of data and identify patterns automatically. We can use that information to predict potential demand and optimize our strategies and prices. See [Demand_Forecasting]()

#### Benefits of Machine Learning for Price Optimisation
Using Python-based machine learning for pricing optimization automates the entire process. You'll invest your time in setting up a retail price optimization project with factors relevant to your pricing strategy, such as historical sales, seasons, weather, inventory, product features, and marketing.

Machine learning analyzes these factors, predicting how price changes impact sales. It also provides real-time insights for more efficient operations.

#### Conclusion
Machine learning is a big help for e-commerce. It tackles challenges faced by retailers by letting them work with larger datasets and more factors than traditional methods. Retailers can customize the model to meet their sales goals, finding the right prices and predicting how demand will change with different conditions.
